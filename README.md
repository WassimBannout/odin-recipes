# Recipe Web Project

This project is a simple HTML website featuring a collection of recipe pages. The main page (`index.html`) links to three individual recipe pages: `avocado-salad.html`, `lasagna.html`, and `pasta.html`. Each recipe page includes an image, a short description of the dish, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step preparation instructions.
